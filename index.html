    <h2>Making <i>My</i> Convincing Argument about STEM Education</h2>
    <p id="metaexplanation">By presenting the factual part of my claim rather than the myth (which I read about in the Debunking Handbook), I am attempting to prevent the Backfire Effect (which I learned about in the truTV video). To help address what Cairo calls the "patternicity bug", I will provide clear and relevent stats and visualizations ("core facts should be displayed graphically if possible" (Debunking Handbook, 6)) that are <strong>simplistic</strong> ("subtracting the obvious and adding the meaningful" (Cairo, 97)) and too the point so as to avoid as much mininterpretation as possible. To help address the "storytelling bug" I will explain in one sentence each and as clearly as possible, what these stats and infographis mean and what narrative they tell. Finally, I will be wary of the "confirmation bug" by rebuttling any forseeable counter arguments to my explanation.</p>
    <br />
    <h3>Example Convincing Claim</h3>
    <p id="explanation">There is a high demand for STEM graduates and specifically computer scientists in the U.S. despite the increasing popularity in technology. According to the US Department of Labor, <quote>US universities are expected to produce only 29% of the required number of grads</quote>. This stat means that there will be 1.4 million in computer science alone not to mention other STEM fields, which hurts the whole economy in the long run as this means that U.S. jobs are being outsourced to keep up with demand. Within the STEM fields, computer science is a field that desperately needs more members in the United States. <br /><br />
    <img id="CSinSTEM" src="https://code.org/images/cs-stats/Slide2_STEM_CS.png"> <br /><br /> This simply means that there are far too few trained students to fill the number of jobs in computer science. This is not because they are not interested (a look around most public places will show you that people are glued to their devices) or that they don't think technological development is important (just look at the number of people who attend unveiling events held by big names like Apple, Google, and Microsoft). It is simply because there are not enough people trained to do the jobs.</p>
    <p><b>What's the solution?</b><br />The solution is education. Earlier and more consistent exposure to computer science will help solve this problem. <br /><br />For more information visit <a href="http://code.org">Code.org</a> or <a href="https://www.idtech.com/"> iDTech.com</a></p>
